# Recipes for LoopBack Models

LoopBack is centered around models which represent business data and behaviors.
Mobile developers often need different ways to interact with models depending on
where the data live and how the data is defined. In this blog, I'll show you a
few recipes to work with LoopBack models to support various use cases.

## An open model

> I'm mobile developer. Can LoopBack help me save and load my data? I don't have
any backend.

## A plain model

> I want to play with LoopBack to see how it can help me create mobile APIs.

## Models by discovery

> I already have data in databases such as Oracle. Can LoopBack figure out the
models and expose them as APIs to my mobile applications?

## Models by instances

> I have JSON documents from REST services or NoSQL databases. Can LoopBack
get my models out of them?

## Model Synchronization

> Now I have defined a LoopBack model, can LoopBack create or update the
database schemas for me?
